# 
Project made for final project of IoT class

With the purpose of controlling the room temperature based on user settings, a system has been developed that can be controlled through a mobile device. In this system, the user sets their desired temperature, and an IoT device receives both the room temperature and the user's desired temperature for comparison. This allows the system to decide whether to keep the air conditioning on or off. As a result, an automated room climate control system is achieved with the assistance of the air conditioning, without the need to keep it running continuously. This approach can lead to energy savings at the end of the month, especially when the room needs to maintain a constant temperature.
